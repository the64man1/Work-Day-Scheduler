# Work-Day-Scheduler

Here is my Work Day Scheduler

Users can enter text for each standard workday hour and save the input to local storage. When a user presses the save icon for a given hour, the border of the input field for that hour will turn red to inform the user that the input has been saved.

I also added a function that will detect if the contents of local storage were saved on a previous day, and if so, will clear local storage and display a message informing the user that the scheduler has been reset. This functionality can be tested by replacing the 'currentDate' variable with the 'testDate' variable in line 19 of the script.js file.

I also added a button at the bottom of the page to allow the user to clear local storage.

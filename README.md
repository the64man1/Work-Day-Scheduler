# Work-Day-Scheduler

Here is my Work Day Scheduler

Users can enter text for each standard workday hour and save the input to local storage. When a user presses the save icon for a given hour, the border of the input field for that hour will turn red to inform the user that the input has been saved.

I also added a function that will detect if the contents of local storage were saved on a previous day, and if so, will clear local storage and display a message informing the user that the scheduler has been reset.

I also added a button at the bottom of the page to allow the user to clear local storage.
